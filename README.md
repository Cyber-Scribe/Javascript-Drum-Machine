# Javascript-Drum-Machine
This is a programmable online Drum Machine using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

It works in most browsers and on most devices. I use Howler to deal with the audio so it uses Web Audio API on any browser that supports it. On older devices or in Explorer it stutters as it doesn't use the Web Audio API, however on most new devices and in most modern browsers it works pretty well.

I wrote this code completely from scratch (excluding the Howler JS file) and it is free for anyone to use/ammend as they want. I also welcome any feedback/advice/criticism as I am relatively new to coding. I wrote this less than two months after "Hello World" so it might not be the tidiest code but it works.

I have removed all the audio samples as GitHub would not allow me to upload that many files. Feel free to add your own samples (I would add you need to make sure they all start with the same length silence at the beginnning to keep sounds in sync).
